# Arduino-Gesture-Car
# Arduino-Powered Hand Gesture Controlled Car 🚗✋

This project implements a **hand gesture controlled robotic car** using **Arduino microcontrollers**, an **MPU6050 sensor**, and **nRF24L01 wireless communication modules**.  
By tilting your hand in different directions, you can control the car’s movement — forward, backward, left, right, or stop.

## 📌 Features
- **Gesture Recognition** using MPU6050 (accelerometer + gyroscope).
- **Wireless Communication** with nRF24L01 module.
- **Motor Control** through L298N H-Bridge driver.
- **4WD Car Chassis** powered by Li-ion 18650 cells.
- Supports **five commands**: Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Stop.
